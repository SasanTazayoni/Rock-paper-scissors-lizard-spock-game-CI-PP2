# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game ‚úä üñê ‚úåÔ∏è ü§è üññ

The game serves as an expanded version of the classic 'Rock Paper Scissors' game, introducing two additional variables for players to choose from. Participants make their selections in unison. Notably, this iteration accommodates more than two players and the likelihood of a tie is significantly reduced. Victory is achieved by outplaying the majority of opponents. In cases of a tie, the game is reiterated until a clear winner emerges.

This specific application is designed for a two-player scenario, involving the user and the computer. Each game consists of 9 rounds, and the first player to secure 5 round victories will clinch the overall game triumph. Round scores will be visibly displayed beneath the available game icons. To initiate play, simply click the button below, make your icon selection, and the computer will then randomly make its choice to compete against you.

You can play the game on the live site [here](https://sasantazayoni.github.io/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-game-CI-PP2/).
