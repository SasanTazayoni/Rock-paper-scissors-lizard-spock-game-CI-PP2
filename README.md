# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game ‚úä üñê ‚úåÔ∏è ü§è üññ

Introducing an enriched iteration of the classic 'Rock Paper Scissors' game, this version introduces two additional variables, elevating the decision-making process to new heights. Players make their selections simultaneously, infusing an element of suspense into each move. While this version is versatile enough for multiple players, this particular application is designed for a captivating two-player interaction, pitting the user against the computer. Triumph is attained by strategically outsmarting the computer's selections and selecting the icon that counters its choice. In the event of a tied match, a rematch ensues, persisting until a decisive victor emerges.

This tailored application revolves around a user-computer dynamic, featuring a sequence of 9 rounds per game. To clinch an overall victory, players must achieve 5 wins within these rounds to win a game. Round scores are prominently displayed below the array of game icons, providing a clear view of the ongoing battle.  Initiating gameplay is effortless: a simple click on the "Play game" button followed by a game icon (‚úä, üñê, ‚úåÔ∏è, ü§è, üññ) in the main user interface and the computer will counter with its own randomised choice, culminating in an engaging clash of wits!

The two-player rendition of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock offers a dynamic and interactive experience, delivering the thrill of competition without necessitating a human adversary. The game's succinct rounds and distinct outcomes cater to convenient entertainment, while the expanded choices and the challenge of predicting the AI's moves provide a rewarding sense of achievement. This approachable design, coupled with inherent replay value, encourages repeated engagement, promoting strategic thinking and ensuring continuous enjoyment.

**Important note for assessors: While the project requirement specifies placing JavaScript code in external files just above the closing body tag, I have opted to enhance the project's performance and best practices by linking the JavaScript file using the 'defer' keyword in the head tag. This ensures an optimal loading sequence while adhering to recommended practices.**

### Design

#### Overall feel

Embodying a modern and captivating aesthetic, this application offers an overall ambience that is both contemporary and visually pleasing. While its primary role is to provide entertainment, it also serves as a valuable tool for resolving disagreements when consensus proves elusive.


#### Colour scheme

![Color Swatches](documentation/colours.png)

This carefully curated color combination blends bold contrasts and soothing shades to enhance user experience, infuse energy, and maintain visual clarity in our web application.

#### Typography

'Exo 2' is the font of choice in this application with a fallback of the font-stack 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'. This was a deliberate decision to align with the game's dynamic and modern aesthetic. With its geometric letterforms and clean lines, Exo 2 effectively captures the energy and excitement that our game offers. Its legibility and versatility ensure that players can navigate effortlessly while being immersed in the vibrant experience we've crafted.

#### Wireframes

Comprehensive wireframes were developed to cater to all screen sizes. The decision to create single wireframes, without the need for variations in different screen sizes, was driven by the minimal impact on design elements beyond font and icon sizes. Explore the wireframes here:

  ![The game icons](documentation/icons.jpg)

* Whenever an icon is clicked, it is compared against the computer's choice (which is random) and the UI is updated accordingly.
    * When the player wins, the round score of the player is incremented by 1 and the player's chosen icon is displayed with maximum opacity and slightly enlarged in the space beneath the player's round score while the computer's choice is displayed with partial opacity in the space beneath the computer's round score: <br>

    ![Winning a round](documentation/win.jpg)

    * When the player loses, the round score of the computer is incremented by 1 and the computer's chosen icon is displayed with maximum opacity and slightly enlarged in the space beneath the computer's round score while the player's choice is displayed with partial opacity in the space beneath the player's round score: <br>

    ![Losing a round](documentation/lose.jpg)

    * In the case of a draw, neither round is incremented and both chosen icons display with partial opacity beneath the respective scores
 
    ![Drawing a round](documentation/draw.jpg)

* After each round, the results are recorded both in the round scores and in the UI so that the player can see their previous choices as well as the computer's. For each round played, the icons selected will appear on top of the icons selected in the previous round (i.e. Older rounds will get pushed down the page). The viewport will extend in size if there are many round played:

    ![Multiple rounds played](documentation/multiround.jpg)

* The game ends when either the player or the computer has 5 round wins. This increments the game scores in the scores modal and is stored in local storage in case the player closes their browser. Text is dynamically inserted into the scores modal depending on whether the player has won or lost the game and then removed when the modal is closed:

    ![End of game text](documentation/dynamictext.jpg)
  
* When the modal is closed after a game end, the round scores reset to 0 for both the player and the computer and all added icons are removed from the page (the game is reset).
* The game scores (but not round scores) can be reset using the reset button in the main UI.
* Each button has a sound effect when hovered over for an enhanced user experience.

### Future features

* A voice recognition can be introduced for a better user experience. This should be able to open the rules, check the scores, close modals, reset and play the game by saying simple commands like "Rules" or "Scores" or "Lizard".
* A feature can be added to allow multiple players to play against each other.
* More sound effects can be added for better user experience.

### Responsinator

Responsinator was used to make sure that the website was fully responsive on all devices. The results can be viewed [here](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsasantazayoni.github.io%2FRock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-game-CI-PP2%2F). <br >

### Third-Party Testing

One of the most helpful ways to test the application was to have a few different people test it on various devices.

| Name | Age | Tech BG |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Joe | 35 | High |
| Varun | 32 | Low |
| Saba | 30 | High |

### Lighthouse testing

Lighthouse was a helpful tool for checking where where the website was experiencing the most issues.

![Lighthouse performance test](documentation/lighthouse.jpg)

The results show that the web application stands as an example of meticulous development, boasting exceptional scores across key criteria. With an unwavering commitment to inclusivity, the application achieves a perfect 100% for accessibility, ensuring that all users can seamlessly engage with its content. Fast loading times contribute to an impeccable 100% performance rating, enhancing the user experience. A strong 100% SEO score reflects the dedication to visibility and discoverability on the web. While the commitment to best practices is evident with a commendable 92%, the relentless pursuit of excellence in every facet is evident. This holistic approach culminates in an application that embodies both cutting-edge technology and user-centric design.

### PowerMapper Compatibility

![PowerMapper compatibility test](documentation/powermapper.jpg)

As the results show, the website is highly compatible across all browsers.

### Bugs

* On a horizontal mobile view with specific phones, it is possible that the rules modal will not allow scrolling throughout the entire height of the modal (i.e. it may be possible that the title of the rules modal and the "Play game" button are inaccessible). This problem has been adjusted to work on most mobiles but not every mobile was available for testing.
* On Google Chrome by default the sound disabled when a new page is rendered - This means that the sound effect for the "Play game" button will initially not play but will after the first user interaction.

## Deployment

1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Locate the [repository](https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-game-CI-PP2).
3. Locate the settings option along the options bar at the top of the page.
4. Locate the 'Pages' option on the left side bar and click on it.
5. Under the 'Branch' subheading there should be a drop-down menu - select 'Master' from the branch options.
6. Click the save button.
7. Github pages will build your website with the code supplied and begin hosting it when it is completed - the process usually takes a few minutes.
8. The website URL will now be visible on the green bar under the section header. This will remain there permanently and you can refer back to it at any time.
