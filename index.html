            The game is an extension on top of the original game - Rock Paper
            Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it
            simultaneously. This game is more interesting because more than two
            players can play together and there is less probability of a draw
            occurring. The winner is the one who defeats most the others. In a
            tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.

            Rock beats scissors and lizard but loses to paper and spock. <br />
            Paper beats rock and spock but loses to scissors and lizard. <br />
            Scissors beats paper and lizard but loses to spock and rock. <br />
            Lizard beats spock and paper but loses to rock and scissors. <br />
            Spock beats rock and scissors but loses to paper and lizard.

            This is all illustrated in the diagram.

            In this particular application, there will only be two players - the
            user and the computer. There will be a total of 9 rounds per game
            for each win which means that the first player to win 5 round will
            win a game.
