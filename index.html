          <p class="modal-content" data-modal-content>
            The game is an extension on top of the original game - Rock Paper
            Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it
            simultaneously. This game is more interesting because more than two
            players can play together and there is less probability of a draw
            occurring. The winner is the one who defeats most the others. In a
            tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.

            In this particular application, there will only be two players - the
            user and the computer. There will be a total of 9 rounds per game
            for each win which means that the first player to win 5 rounds will
            win a game. In order to play <span class="bold">click on the icon</span> 
            of your choice and the computer will select randomly.
