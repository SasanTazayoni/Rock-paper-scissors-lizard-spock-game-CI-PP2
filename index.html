        <h2>How it works (rules)</h2>
        <p>
          The game is an extension on top of the original game - Rock Paper
          Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it
          simultaneously. This game is more interesting because more than two
          players can play together and there is less probability of a draw
          occurring. The winner is the one who defeats most of the others. In a
          tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.

          In this particular application, there will only be two players - the
          user and the computer. There will be a total of 9 rounds per game
          for each win which means that the first player to win 5 rounds will
          win a game. The round scores will be indicated just below the selectable 
          game icons. In order to play click on the button below and then 
          <span class="bold">select an icon</span> of your choice and the
          computer will select also randomly against you.
